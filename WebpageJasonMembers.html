			<h3 id="Introduction">Original Members</h3>
			<p>The "classic" line-up of the hugely successful Guns n' Roses consisted of lead singer Axl Rose, lead guitarist Slash, rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin, bassist Duff McKagan, and drummer Steven Adler.
			GNR was made of a combination of two bands - LA Guns and Hollywood Rose - therefore creating the name Guns n' Roses. Izzy and Axl were childhood friends from the town of Lafayette, Indiana, and both 
			went to the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles to pursue a career in music. Slash and Steven were also childhood friends, and played together in various bands, including Road Crew before joining GNR. Duff was
			a punk rocker honour student from Seattle, and also moved to LA to pursue a music career. Guns n' Roses went through many changes and struggles to become the band we know today.</p>

			<p>W. Axl Rose, born William Bruce Rose Jr. and raised William Bruce Bailey, was born on February 6, 1962 in the small town of Lafayette, Indiana. He is most known being the lead singer of Guns n' Roses,
			and has also been the only static member of the group since its formation. He is also the lead vocalist for AC/DC since 2016 due to health issues of former lead singer, Brian Johnson. He is praised for 
			his unbelievable range and energy, earning him respect for one of the best vocalists of all time. Axl's mother was 16 years old when she had him, and his father was 20. His parents separated when he was 
			2 years old, and his mother remarried. Axl says his childhood was very oppressive, and his father was very strict and religious. Axl escaped all of this with music, as he sang in a choir since he was 5, 
			and he studied piano. After discovering who his biological father was, he called himself W. Rose. Upon discovering this, he was arrested over 20 times. He then moved to Los Angeles in 1982 to begin a career 
			in music.</p>
